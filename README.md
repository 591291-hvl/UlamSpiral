# UlamSpiral

This project was originally started first semester in java, but now revived in python with a goal to generate large images. 

ulamSpiralMatplotlib.py - generates live animation ulam spiral, partially scrapped because of slow speed

ulamSpiralPyCairo.py - generates images for any given size

ulamSpiralPolarCords.py - was given as a challenge by https://github.com/BirkJohannessen/PrimeSpiral.git


Image generated with PyCairo
